## Short Biography

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University (OSU). I'm fortunately working with Prof. [Ping Zhang](https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~zhang.10631/) in AIMed (Artificial Intelligence in Medicine) Lab. My research focuses on the intersection of deep learning and causal inference, with the overarching goal of enhancing accurate causal estimation and enabling reliable decision-making in healthcare and biomedicine.
