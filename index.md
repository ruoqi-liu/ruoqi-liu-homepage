## Short Biography [<a href="https://ruoqi-liu.github.io/Ruoqi-Liu-CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>]

I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University (OSU). I'm fortunately working with Prof. [Ping Zhang](https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~zhang.10631/) in AIMed (Artificial Intelligence in Medicine) Lab. My research interests focus on data mining, causal inference and their applications in healthcare.
